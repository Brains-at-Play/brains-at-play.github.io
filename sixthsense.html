            <h2>Version 1</h2>
            <p>Dimitris Grammenos ran the (invited) workshop <strong>The 6th sense:
                A speculative game design workshop.</strong> Garrett Flynn participated in the workshop.
            </p>
            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p> Intellectual exchange and networking is the usual goal of academic workshops. The desire to replicate the workshop at USC with university students emerged from this experience and Grammenos was invited by Marientina Gotsis and Dong Song to plan a new workshop.
            </p>
            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>The invited workshop was part of the 1st Workshop on Digital Games for Digital Literacy and Computational Thinking hosted by International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games 2020.

            <h2>Version 2</h2>
            <p>Based on observations and feedback received the first time the workshop was held, it has been edited and updated. Also, a Greek version was created.
            </p>
            <p>Three complementary online events have been planned in Greece which will be held under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.futures.gr/unesco-chair/" class="text">Greek UNESCO Research Chair in Futures Research</a></p>
            <h3>October 26th, 2020</h3>
            <p>Aimed at Primary and Secondary Education Informatics Educators to get them onboarded/interested in participating with their schools in the 18 December version (see below), as well as to get constructive feedback. A case study will take place using observation methods, questionnaires and a focus group.</p>
            <p>The workshop is organised by FORTH in collaboration with the Regional Center of Educational Design of Crete. Since educators stated that they are particularly interested in Ethical, Privacy and Personal Data Issues, Anthi Strataki, Data Protection Officer of FORTH, will make a guest appearance to the workshop covering and discussing related issues. The case study is in collaboration with the COMnPLAY SCIENCE EU-funded project (FORTH/Dimitris Grammenos is a partner).
            </p>
            <h3>December 18th, 2020</h3>

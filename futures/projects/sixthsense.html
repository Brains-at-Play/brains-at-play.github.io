            <h2>Version One</h2>
            <i>September 14th, 2020</i>
            <p>A short and fast-paced workshop about creating a digital game employing futuristic brain-to-brain interaction (BBI) technologies. The workshop starts with a brief introduction to speculative design and to the current status and envisioned capabilities of BBI technologies. Subsequently, through a series of engaging and fun series of design exercises, participants are guided towards conceptualizing, designing and playtesting a BBI game. To ensure a smooth experience for everyone, participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of Zoom, Google Docs and Google Slides. The main goals of the workshop are creative thinking and having fun.

            <h2>Project Details (v2)</h2>

            <p>Three complementary online events have been planned in Greece which will be held under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.futures.gr/unesco-chair/" class="text">Greek UNESCO Research Chair in Futures Research</a></p>
            <h3>Onboarding</h3>
            <i>October 26th, 2020</i>
            <p>Aimed at Primary and Secondary Education Informatics Educators to get them onboarded/interested in participating with their schools in the 18 December version (see below), as well as to get constructive feedback. A case study will take place using observation methods, questionnaires and a focus group.</p>
            <p>The workshop is organised by FORTH in collaboration with the Regional Center of Educational Design of Crete. Since educators stated that they are particularly interested in Ethical, Privacy and Personal Data Issues, Anthi Strataki, Data Protection Officer of FORTH, will make a guest appearance to the workshop covering and discussing related issues. The case study is in collaboration with the COMnPLAY SCIENCE EU-funded project (FORTH/Dimitris Grammenos is a partner).
            </p>

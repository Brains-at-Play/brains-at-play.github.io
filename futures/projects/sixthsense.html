            <i>September 14th, 2020</i>
            <p>A short and fast-paced workshop about creating a digital game employing futuristic brain-to-brain interaction (BBI) technologies. The workshop starts with a brief introduction to speculative design and to the current status and envisioned capabilities of BBI technologies. Subsequently, through a series of engaging and fun series of design exercises, participants are guided towards conceptualizing, designing and playtesting a BBI game.

        <p>The October Onboarding workshop was organised by FORTH in collaboration with the Regional Center of Educational Design of Crete. Since educators stated that they are particularly interested in Ethical, Privacy and Personal Data Issues, Anthi Strataki, Data Protection Officer of FORTH, will make a guest appearance to the workshop covering and discussing related issues. The case study is in collaboration with the COMnPLAY SCIENCE EU-funded project (FORTH/Dimitris Grammenos is a partner).

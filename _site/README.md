# Brains at Play website
This is the repo containing the [Brains@Play Website](https://brainsatplay.com).

Under `sdk/examples` we include a visualizer that works with live streamed data from OpenBCI headsets (currently, it uses a sample, pre-recorded data stream)



## About the Brains@Play initiative
The Brains@Play Futures Initiative seeks to ensure the responsible design and development of brain-responsive multiplayer experiences through the production of public design workshops, educational resources, and open-source software tools.

            <h1><strong>Curriculum</strong></h1>
            <p>Play, games, and the principles that underlie them have an essential role in building critical skills like
    systems thinking, creative problem solving, collaboration, empathy, and innovation. In this course,
    prepare to put your thinking caps on (both literal and metaphorical) and envision multiplayer games
    controlled by the human brain! Through weekly design fiction and game design exercises, students will
    become acquainted with emerging issues at the intersection of neuroscience, ethics, and society-and
    develop submissions to the Brains and Games International Design Fiction Competition on March
    20th, 2021. The only requirement for this course is, naturally, an open mind.</p>

                This module introduces the course goals, the Brains and Games International Design Fiction
                Competition, and the history of neurotechnology devices in academic research, clinical practice,
                industry, and the arts.

                This module introduces Design Fiction as a method for exploring and critically analyzing possible
                futures through designed artifacts. Students start generating ideas for their Brains and Games
                submissions.

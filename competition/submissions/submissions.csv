They can fight or negotiate to take the leadership of their group and to rule the other groups.

Players should use B2B devices to surf around, make tools, find things, and communicate with each other. They should ""think"" to do stuff on the island. The one with the greater power to concentrate, knowledge to build, and skills to communicate is the one that rules the whole community.

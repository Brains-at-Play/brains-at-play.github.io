All that while blending retro with BBI gaming!,"Garden invaders is a cooperative game for two players. The main concept is that the players control a farmer that tries to protect his crops against the invading horde of gophers. The first player controls the farmer’s movement, and the second, controls the farmer’s sling. From the right side of the screen (the farmer will be on the left), the enemies will appear at certain points in waves. They will be shooting objects that the players will have to avoid, and behind the approaching enemies there will be their leader, also shooting objects. Once the players clear a wave of enemies, they will have some time to shoot at their leader before the new wave arrives. The players win when they have brought the enemy leader’s life to zero.
Below is a sample drawing that gives the main idea about the game screen:
",F_1gkdDbV71FSJfeI,GardenInvaders_Sketch.jpg,81624,image/jpeg,"The game can last anywhere from 5 up to 15 minutes, because of its online nature.",The goal is to defeat all the gophers that invade the farm.,"The game’s theme consists of three things, humorous because of its non serious nature,  and retro",2 to 2,Yes,2,"Well in a short the players are required to not share any characteristics. In greater detail one shall act like an angry farmer and the other shall act like a sling, for example when the farmer is being under attack it is logical for the player controlling the farmers moves to try and avoid the shots, while the player that controls the sling should try and hit more gophers. In other words the players ought to communicate about when to hit next and about how to avoid the shots.",Yes,"There is one other type of brain involved, that is the A.I. of the game that controls the aiming and the movement of the gophers. ","Players ought to be right in front of the screen in order to easily see the actions that take place ","What the players will gain from playing this game is coordination of moves and conciliation. In other words playing this game is an excellent multitasking practice because multitasking is a requirement, players have to make moves while also being conscious about gophers positions and throw trajectories.
","The players control the farmer’s movement and also the time that his sling shoots. By moving, they reach the line of the approaching gophers, and by using the sling, they knock them out.
",,,,,"By blinking the left eye, the first player can move the farmer up, and by blinking the right eye, they can move the farmer down. By blinking any eye, the second player can make the sling shoot.
",,,,,"The players, except from the things that the game itself does not allow them to do, they cannot use vulgar language, act in a selfish manner, or use violence between them.
",,,,,Yes,"The winners are the two players that play the game. The farmer will start with five lives. He loses them when he gets hit by the objects that the gophers throw (small stones or badgers as bombs), or when the gophers manage to reach the farmer’s crops. The players win when they have successfully defended the crops, and brought the enemy leader’s life to zero.

	It is mandatory for the brain control interface itself to respect the privacy of its users too. In other words the device shall be licensed under the open hardware initiative so that the circuitry is open to the public.

But make no mistake, the tools at your disposal are to ensure both your mental and physical survival. Brains become passages to the darkest depths of imagination as players conjure up different mirages and illusions that manifest in the physical plane. The inner machinations of their minds are weaponized in an attempt to overtake one another in this bizarre take on survival of the fittest.

The star players are those who can craft the greatest mind-bending  illusions while maintaining a grip on their own sanity to navigate the insane delusions that their opponents put them through. The losers are those who cannot distinguish fantasy from reality - they are doomed to exile from the outside world, for their minds have been tricked to revolve around a hallucination while their bodies wither away from lack of sustenance.",,,,,"For inexperienced players, minutes or even seconds. For a game between masters, hours or even days. ",The goal of the game is simple: Survival. You must overcome and destroy your opponent's mind without allowing them to do the same to you. The game is over when one player is incapacitated - this equates to the player’s psyche and perception of reality being utterly shattered. There may also be an extrinsic goal for a player.

The rules do not facilitate or encourage the creation of teams or partnerships; however, they do not discourage them either.

Those who walk out of the game with unbroken minds get to keep the capability to function in society.","Players wear a specialized VR headset which hooks into an implanted brain machine interface to allow them to manifest nightmares and hallucinations into each other's minds with the explicit goal of inflicting the most amount of psychological trauma; the last player standing is the winner. Spectators are common, and underground tournaments where large amounts of money are bet are quickly becoming extremely popular. The game is most commonly played with 2 players, though there is no set limit.",,,,,"Due to the nature of the game, an implanted mind machine interface is necessary in order to play, and at least two players are required. The devices link wirelessly to each other and a nearby computer running the actual software for the game. Every game is automatically recorded in its entirety from the moment at least two players are linked into the game, and the perspectives of each player(overlayed with any ""attacks"" from other players) can be displayed on any connected monitors easily.",,,,,"There are few strict rules. Physical contact and modification of the device is illegal, and audience interference is forbidden. It is also highly discouraged for players to engage in games with anyone such that a noticeable gap in skill is present. This is to prevent any unfair advantages during matches, as well as to maintain high interest among onlookers. Finally, no substitutions are allowed during a match - the players that begin a game must stay throughout its duration.",,,,,Yes,"The game only ends when all players except for one are physically unable to continue. Winners are those who successfully overcome their opponents’ minds through illusions and unsettling visions that they create. Depending on how badly a mirage scars a loser’s mind, they may be rendered clinically insane for the rest of their lives. There is no case where someone can win if their opponent(s) gives up a match, as surrendering defeats the entire purpose of the game.",,,,,"Devil's Game has drawn a considerable amount of ire from local law enforcement and governments, who see it as a barbaric and brutal bloodsport with no place in modern society, and there's frankly probably a lot of truth to that. The game was explicitly created to cause harm for the enjoyment of others, and many people have been traumatized, hospitalized, or even killed after a loss. Common side-effects after a brutal defeat include tremors, insomnia, recurring nightmares, audio and visual hallucinations, erratic behavior, and violent mood swings.

The original programmer is unknown, though very likely still involved in some capacity as the software continues to recieve live patches occasionally, and there are rumours that a variant exists designed to allow one user to torture or ""brain-hack"" another individual. The game has been made illegal in California and most of the surrounding states as a result of all of this, though its underground appeal has yet to stop growing.",No,,"In the dark hearts of the biggest cities in Southern California, a dangerous new entertainment craze is gaining an alarming amount of popularity, despite both public outcry and police attempts to control and regulate it.
Dubbed the ‘Devil's Game’ by the street gangs who peddle it, this new craze allows two users to link their minds together at a subconscious level through the use of a specialized headset and the player's own mind machine interface. The link allows the players to manifest horrible visions into each other's minds, with the explicit intention of causing psychological harm to the other player. The game only ends when one player is physically unable to continue, and many never recover from a loss.
In spite of, or perhaps even directly because of, the gruesome nature of this ‘game’, it has become an extremely popular underground spectator sport. Gang-affiliated clubs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and many other cities frequently host exposition matches and even entire tournaments where onlookers bet sometimes thousands of dollars on the outcome of the gruesome match. Sadly, these are all too easy to find in most parts of the state, and alarmingly it seems to be spreading east.

Fun: games should be more than a novelty to serve the hardware, they should make organic sense and provoke experiential learning.
Understandable: anyone should be able to pick up the game and understand the mechanics and goal within 15 seconds. For every action players make in the game, there should be a corresponding feedback mechanism in place.

Cheap: If at all possible resources should be acquired through ccl or other free forms of materials. These can be replaced or purchased once financial funding is acquired. Games will be licensed to universities and non profits through Creative Commons.

Knowledge-based: all games will be approached and designed using the latest evidence-based scientific research. Collection of personal data will be opt-in and/or anonymized according to research protocols. Users shall retain all rights to their data according to EFF and HIPAA guidelines.

Integration: We will respect players as individuals and be mindful of their intersections. All efforts shall be made to accommodate those of different races/genders/cultures/abilities/physical and mental health diagnoses.

Thoughtful: Games are art.  If at all possible attempts will be made to highlight under-represented groups in narrative. The game should serve to expose and heighten the human experience.

Brain privacy/security poses a real issue, such that a hacker can attempt to “read” other people’s thoughts by obtaining them as the device transits the information to an interpreter or by hacking into a database storing player-specific information. Additionally, brain hacking can pose an issue if someone were to attempt sending information to a player’s brain (even if our game wasn’t designed to do so). User safety is an unlikely issue with our game, but should not be discounted if the tech were to fail.
Lastly, another area of concern is the emotional maturity of players. Our game aims to simulate the life of the pirate and plays on themes, such as betrayal. As a result, we expect our players to have a certain level of maturity (ages of 10+) that would allow them to play without being deeply affected by the actions of other players.",Yes,"	In regards to user safety (and brain hacking), we chose not to implement any features that require sending any information directly to the player’s brain because this could harm the user and risks the overwriting of any previous memories. Instead, we decided to use a laptop, mobile phone, or any other screen as a middleman to display player-specific information. For example, their screen will show their perspective, the number of map pieces, and their options for interacting with other players. Additionally, the technology will not be used to send any vibrations, shocks, or physical stimulation that could pose harm to the player. As a player’s HP decreases, we will only indicate the loss of HP on their screen.

	For brain privacy and security, we do not have any specific safeguards. However, we hope to use the best level of encryption for receiving information from the user, storing any necessary information, and displaying player-specific information on their individual screens. Depending on the technology, it might be hard to regulate what information is being obtained from the user (i.e. random thought vs. body movement). We hope to isolate which information is necessary to play the game (i.e. brain activity signalling movement of a specific part of the body) and discard any other information. 

	As for the emotional maturity aspect, we advise that only players of ages 10+ play the game. However, we cannot physically stop certain people from playing the game.","We’ve designed additional features that can enhance or undermine the gameplay of players and can be used to their benefit to build versatile strategies to win.
 
Players can gain bonus points when they execute an action respective of their type of pirate. As a thief, players should steal from other players during attack mode. As a joker, players should sabotage other players by collecting materials and setting up traps. As an executioner, players should inflict damage to other players during attack mode.
 
To ensure that all players can experience the whole gameplay whether one wins or loses, the game enables players that have reached zero health points to continue as pirate ghosts. As a pirate ghost, they can view all map pieces of living pirates and using that information, pirate ghosts can choose to sabotage or aid a player in active mini-games between two players or two teams.
 
In addition to the interactive environment between the setting and players, the game has additional features such as hidden skills which players can utilize. These skills can be found and obtained by scavenging through the ship, but players can only equip one skill at a time. Some skills are activated all throughout the game or are of one-time use. Moreover, traps are laid out on the ship and can be set up by players using obtained materials. Lastly, different weather conditions can occur every ten minutes in which the ship can be subjected to strong waves, hail or thunderstorms.",,,,,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lastly, experiences before entering SaṃsāRa are retained and memories continue to be retained even after multiple respawns in the game throughout the player’s immortality.","In Ra mode, players are able to be as innovative and imaginative as they choose to be with the guidance of Ra, the first mythical Egyptian AI guide in SaṃsāRa. In Jah mode, players can strengthen their memory and mindfulness through rehabilitation with Jah, the second mythical Egyptian AI guide.  Episodes from memory produced in either Jah or Ra mode can be edited, curated, and shared for other players to experience themselves. ",,,,,"Players are able to visualize their worlds throughout their immortality through the use of BCI and VR tech, where the visual stimuli of their SaṃsāRa experience is produced through simulations similar to those produced by the phosphene phenomenon.  However, our simulations will have visual aspects that make the game play a first person view experience.",,,,,"However the experience is meant to play out, that is how it will be played out.  Players have no capability to change the outcome of that experience, but they have the autonomy over how they may feel about the experience and the outcome of their own experiences.  But, in Ra mode, the world of SaṃsāRa is theirs to mold, and game play performance depends on the players cognitive capabilities.",,,,,No,,,,,,"One of the ethical issues this game poses is the question as to who has agency when it comes to the type of data collected by the BCI. Is it in the hands of the player? Or is the type of data and what is done with the data completely dictated by Immori? Another ethical issue in SaṃsāRa is, what are the long term implications of using both the invasive version of the BCI for brain-bodied players, and the exterior model for able-bodied players? How can players be protected, and what can be done to ensure safety? How will the safety standards for such devices be regulated? Lastly, in terms of player well being, is it ethical to allow players to feel pain in SaṃsāRa? Does feeling emotional pain pose an issue?  How can brain-bodied players opt out of living in SaṃsāRa if they no longer wish to stay?  Furthermore, how will deviant behavior be regulated? Where are the lines drawn for what can be done in game? ",Yes,"One of the first ethical issues raised is the user’s behavior and agency when it comes to the BCI data and how the data may be used. In conjunction with top research institutions, institutional review boards (IRB) have approved ethical data production and collection during game play.  Through the IRBs, player confidentiality agreements were formulated and thoroughly discussed before players carried out game play.  The user’s data is being recorded the whole time they are in the game to improve gameplay and this is made transparent through the terms and conditions which players must agree to before they are allowed into the game. Furthermore, Immori ensures that the user has autonomy over their brain activity during game play, so the BCI is not controlling the players' experiences.  However, upon the player signing the confidentiality agreement, they are aware that the outcome of other players' experiences is not theirs to change. In summary, players are fully aware of the type of brain data being collected and how this data will be used to further the greater good of humanity within the 21st century and beyond.  

Lastly, Immori states that they do not read the user's deep thoughts because it is not necessary for game control. However, a group of activists claim that Immori is secretly recording all of the user’s personal thoughts. Immori is committed to full transparency with players and activists alike, and hopes to educate the general population.
","SaṃsāRa is meant to be used as a tool to implement mindfulness interventions and improve memory in players. Jah will encourage ways to actively reinforce mindful habits that can positively impact memory performance if they become life-long. We envision SaṃsāRa as a world of endless opportunity that can improve the quality of life for a range of players, from those who struggle with maintaining memory, to those who may climb emotional battles everyday, and everyone in between.
 
Furthermore, outside of helping a general community, we plan to make SaṃsāRa a game that could help a range of patient populations. For Alzheimer's disease patients, SaṃsāRa can help them curate their memories of positive habits that they would like to maintain through the progression of their disease. For those with autism, or ASD, who may rely on habit and regularity, SaṃsāRa may provide that to them through the daily creative and mindfulness sessions. SaṃsāRa is an innovative game that will accomplish these goals.  
By using brain waves while playing SaṃsāRa, a user’s psychological state can be tracked. The players emotion can be translated to an appropriate facial expression in their digital avatar. This gives visual feedback to users, which may help ASD populations become better equipped in recognizing emotion. We believe building SaṃsāRa as a therapeutic environment is the starting point for tapping into the medical benefits of using a BCI based gaming experience in clinical and research settings",,,,,Yes,Yes,"Three members from our team collaborated in HackSC 2021 and won the “Device” category. Our HackSC team developed a JavaScript game accessible to anyone, including people with severe motor deficits such as quadriplegic cerebral palsy. Our goal was to create an infinite runner game where the in game character can be controlled by the player via the Muse BCI headset.  With this goal in mind, we built a Three.js + Brains@Play.js game accessible to anyone that has a browser and internet connection. To further develop BrainRunner, we plan to integrate ways to detect player relaxation via alpha wave input.  The more relaxed a player is the easier the game will be, encouraging mindful and meditative playing.  
One member has worked on Hololens 2 in the past for game development under the Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality course taught by Vangelis Impouridis at the University of Southern California (USC). CRASH is a collaborative MR game where the player has to defeat a game boss by shooting virtual, finger-tap triggered bullets and a virtual joystick to control a real-world Kuri robot. 
Our team is a cross-disciplinary collaboration of students from USC and the University of San Francisco, ranging in disciplines from computer science to neuroimaging, and informatics to data science. All four members of our team are eager learners and believe our diverse backgrounds can make our ideas involving VR and BCI a reality.

Please also refer to the the following selected image at this link that pairs with the poem: https://rotarynewsonline.org/ten-blind-men-hindoostan/ 

Entropy is always increasing and, similarly, complexity is always increasing. As such, information-based complexity, a product of uncertainty and non-linearity, must be increasing gradually, must be greater distorting our senses of 'reality' and 'understanding.' However, it is in recent years that this phenomenon of increased complication has become especially prevalent, and relevant, so much so to the point where a lack of proper care may be dangerous, and irresponsible. As the mere mention of such complex terms instigates more complex thought, it may be important to entertain some of these complex questions in order to make greater sense, that is, through the ponderance of what reality 'is', and, perhaps more elusively, what understanding 'necessitates?'

Emotia is a project that seeks to illuminate the complexity and abstractness that encapsulates human emotion, and doing so through a user-interface platform that demystifies linguistic complexity between multiple users. By utilizing a lexicon-based emotion classifier tethered to “Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions,” neural activity in the brain can be interpreted and categorized to various states of affectivity which are based on the involved participant’s textual patterns (in the context of the demo, the textual patterns have been acquired from a Twitter database). With synergic output as the source of synchronicity and connection between the parties involved, users are able to more accurately understand the emotional differences in speech-based patterns among multiple users worldwide, allowing for a stronger spatial awareness on an individual level and greater perception on a more universal level. Not only does this provide for a new level of understanding and closeness between two people, but it could ultimately change the way we understand emotions and affective communication.

**At its core, Emotia aims to bridge the gap of emotional misrepresentation among members all over the world when the linguistical elements that make up their experiences may otherwise appear identical. Just as it is difficult to convey the meaning behind certain cultures or actions from the perspective of an outsider, there is nevertheless a common ground to be searched for, and that common ground stems from emotion. With Emotia, we are able to generate deeper understanding between humans.**","Given more time and resources, we would like to link states of emotional complexity on a greater mathematical framework that allows for more complicated affective states, namely that which encapsulates two or more emotions. Moreover, we would like also like to encapsulate other unique, defining characteristics of human emotion such as through the inclusion of emotion-based hues and/or sounds which could convey a greater sense of “understanding.”

Additionally, we aim to conduct live tests with interested users to illustrate the practicality and feasibility of the concept, as opposed to using pre-recorded data. It is also worth noting that the precision of the location (which remains country-wide) can be increased to more accurately represent emotional diversity within various communities around the world where lesser known interpretations may not otherwise come to light.

Our technology also has the potential to be used to understand the affective states of non-communicative patients, such as locked-in patients, enabling them to affectively (and effectively) communicate to their loved ones. Members that have a hard time displaying their emotional states would surely benefit from the technology, especially those with autism who may otherwise have trouble exhibiting their thoughts and feelings.","Oscar is none other than a curious manifestation of billions of exploding neurons.

Up to the player or moderator’s discretion, for any specific phobia or aversion’s simulation, there can be some sort of guiding text or voice, along with relaxing music and sound effects that positively affirm the experience and sets reinforcing intentions and motivational thoughts or suggestions on approaching the fear/obstacle they’re trying to expose themselves to. Certain tools or styles can be set up depending on the patient’s preferred approaches or even making them adaptable to their biometric feedback.

Additionally, the usage of EEGs could potentially be abused to read other player’s thoughts, particularly if they are in sync with each other and then used to manipulate them for a more nefarious goal in the game space. Ideally however the players should be incentivized to cooperate off the bat due to their desire to improve cooperation and develop more understanding of each other and their preferred ways of communicating.",Yes,"If players are perceived to be acting in a particular manner that is inimical to the larger community or perceived as hostile, the environment will begin to resist them, causing their efforts to be diminished. Once they become more cooperative, the environment becomes more responsive. If a player is outwardly disruptive, for example, enough feedback of hostile tone or contrarian behavior, they might be ejected from the game. ","Emotional audio processing can be used to give critique and induce players to talk in a calm, relaxed, consistent way that is conducive to people listening and taking in the information best. In a stressful situation you don’t want to have an aggressive tone of voice, you want to communicate in an empathetic way. Perhaps have set reminders or flags that let people know whether they are on a good track or not. It has applications for family issues, making a space where everyone’s feelings are taken into account and they can get another perspective on their behaviors, habits, and moods through brain activity when taking and giving directions. It could be used to settle disputes between children or coworkers, with a feelings circle that attracts responses to communication scenarios and teaches cooperation. Noosphere is an experience great for workshops, leadership summits, or even family therapy. The game is about learning and honing skills to be a better listener, leader, and relationship-builder and manager.

We aim to give an opportunity for players to connect and have fun. Our game encompasses 3 main principles, the players, the keys, and the levels. The participants will have to work together and collect various keys, hidden throughout the map, in order to complete the level. Each player will control a red or blue figure and can navigate the levels using a BCI, brain to computer interface. Along with this, the partners will be paired randomly and
 
anonymously to encourage teamwork. This orientation gives the players a safe space to express their ideas and thoughts, otherwise some players may purposely try to lose and be impolite.

The safety of being anonymous can cause players to be irresponsible with their actions. It is quite possible that a player can act in an insolent manner when communicating with their teammate.
